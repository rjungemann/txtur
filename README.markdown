# Share snippets with Txtur

You want to share a short story, poem, or some other snippet of text with people on Facebook.

But Facebook doesn't give you enough control. On the other hand, a Google Doc is too heavy handed.

Txtur lets you simply write, then share it with your friends with zero friction.

Simply:

* Create a snippet, whether it's poetry, code, prose, etc.
* Format your text with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>. Include links, external images, etc.
* Effortlessly share your snippets on Facebook, or send people the link!

We will be adding other features such as tagging, voting, and privacy settings. So check back soon!

What are you waiting for? Txt urs!
